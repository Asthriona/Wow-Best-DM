                    Hey! I'm Asthriona, big wow player I also play Rythms Games as OSU!, DDR (Arcade), Stepmania and GTA RP. As person I kinda suck.
                    I dont have a name except "Asthriona". On wow you can find me Playing with my guild "<a href="http://TheWall.ovh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wall</a>" 
                    or level another alt. I'm not a super good player, but I love Tanking and Healing. and because i'm not really good, it make pretty funny situation with the "ELITE" of this game.
                    You obviously know what I mean, those guy's who thinks know everything about that game, always pull packs of mobs in front of the tank, and yell whenever you wipe for a reason or another
                    Well Those guys if you kick them, they will DM you or a team mate to show how angry they are, And I love playing with them. That why I made this web site :p<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Except Playing games I code a lot, Mainly JS but I try playing with C to make funny things like sort algo and stuff like that.<br>
                    I build a Discord bot called "<a href="http://yukiko.nishikino.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yukiko</a>" in reference of the character in Persona 4.
                    (Yes I'm a Persona fan. Thanks you <a href="http://twitch.tv/woops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">woops</a>).

                <p class="text-justify">
                    I build this website using Vue &amp; Nuxt. For the base I used my blog code because it was pretty much what I needed and the code was already here. it saved me a lot of time.<br>
                    for the back-end I use <a href="http://storyblok.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storyblok.com</a>, Simple, easy and fast.<br>
                    I'm also using a bit of boostrap and I think that's it ^w^
